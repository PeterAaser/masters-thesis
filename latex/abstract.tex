% The human brain is a vastly complex network of neurons capable of computing in a
% robust, vastly parallel and energy efficient manner 
The human brain is a vastly parallel, energy efficient and robust computing
machine that arises from the self-organizing capabilities of billions of neurons.
However, in spite of over a century of study, the fundamental principles that
gives rise to the complex networks that make up the brain is still poorly
understood.
%
By cultivating neural tissue from human stem cells in special special petri
dishes lined with electrodes capable of measuring and inducing electrical
signals, small neural networks can be studied and interacted with.
%
To study how neural tissue self-organizes into computationally capable networks
a cyborg (short for cybernetic organism, a hybrid between biological and
mechanical) is being created by the NTNU cyborg project.
%
The focus of this thesis is the closed loop system where a digital computer
interfaces with the neural tissue 
%
The machine learning technique of reservoir computing is used to create a
two-way bridge between neural cultures and digital logic, creating a closed loop
system in which the neurons can control a simulated robot without human intervention.
%
This thesis focuses on the theoretical and practical challenges of establishing
the bridge between neural cultures and digital logic
