% The human brain is a vastly complex network of neurons capable of computing in a
% robust, vastly parallel and energy efficient manner 
The human brain is a vastly parallel, energy efficient and robust computing
machine that arises from the self-organizing capabilities of billions of neurons.
However, in spite of over a century of study, the fundamental principles that
gives rise to the complex networks that make up the brain is still poorly
understood.
%
By cultivating neural tissue from human stem cells in special special petri
dishes lined with electrodes capable of measuring and inducing electrical
signals, small neural networks can be studied and interacted with.
%
To study how neural tissue self-organizes into computationally capable networks
a cyborg (short for cybernetic organism, a hybrid between biological and
mechanical) is being created by the NTNU cyborg project.
%
The focus of this thesis is the design and implementation of a closed loop
system where a digital computer interfaces with the neural tissue, forming a
two-way bridge allowing the cyborg to learn how to navigate a simulated robot
through a maze with no human intervention.
%
The theoretical framework of reservoir computing is presented, providing a
technique for communicating with neural cultures which is then used to implement
a working proof of concept system allowing neural tissue located at the st.olavs
hospital to control a small simulated robot over an internet connection.
