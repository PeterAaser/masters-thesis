\section*{\Acknowledgements}
\begin{center}

  Dedicated to the trailblazers whose steps I'm retracing, to all those who
helped me out asking nothing in return, and to all those who come after. More
specifically, I'm grateful towards my advisor Gunnar Tufte for his thoughtful
advice and for the freedom he has given me to choose my own approach, only
correcting my course when absolutely necessary.
