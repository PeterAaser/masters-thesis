The goal of this thesis has been to produce a working proof of concept for
a neuro-digital hybrid.
While this has not been achieved the necessary scaffolding is in place, and the
system is capable of performing to specification in all cases save apart from
application of stimuli.
In addition to the stated goal a relatively sophisticated storage solution has
been implemented, and a web-based user interface is being worked on, which will
allow automatisation of the experiment workflow once it is further developed.
While far from complete the system is already capable of performing most tasks
currently handled by the vendor supplied software.
While replacing this software is not a project goal, it gives an idea of the
effort necessary to make the lab equipment behave.
\section{Further Work}
\subsubsection{Finishing the stated goal of the thesis}
While the lack of results make it hard to draw a scientifically valuable
conclusion it at least makes the further work section easy to write.
The obvious first task is to figure out what is causing stimuli to not work
which is simply a matter of time.
\subsubsection{Restoring Characteristics of damaged networks}
In addition to running the experiment sketched described in this thesis, the
flexibility and genericity of the pipeline allows other research with little
effort.
This flexibility will be leveraged in a planned experiment where the pipeline
will record certain characteristics of a healthy neural culture and then attempt
to restore characteristics of the network after it has been damaged.
\subsubsection{Exploring capabilities of other reservoirs}
The Socrates project is currently exploring the capabilities of artificial spin
ice (ASI).
Although the project is currently on the simulator stage, the computational
capabilities of ASI have been shown to have many similarities to those of
neurons.
Once the project has produced a physical prototype it will be easy to plug in to
SHODAN, which can provide a head-to-head comparison of neural and ASI
capabilities.
\subsubsection{Modeling the growth rules of neurons}
By learning more about how neurons organize themselves models can be made that
can more closely mimic the growth done by real neural tissue.
This could help neural networks close some of the gap between their current
specific intelligence bringing them at least one step closer to general
intelligence.
