\chapter{Conclusion And Further Work}
\epigraph{The future will be better tomorrow.}{Vice president Dan Quayle (R)}
The goal of this thesis has been to show produce a working proof of concept for
a neuro-digital hybrid.
While this has not been achieved the necessary scaffolding is in place, and the
system is capable of performing to specification in all cases save apart from
application of stimuli.
In addition to the stated goal a relatively sophisticated storage solution has
been implemented, and a web-based user interface is being worked on, which will
allow automatisation of the experiment workflow once it is further developed.
While far from complete the system is already capable of performing most tasks
currently handled by the vendor supplied software.
While replacing this software is not a project goal, it gives an idea of the
effort necessary to make the lab equipment behave.
\section{Further Work}
While the lack of results make it hard to draw a scientifically valuable
conclusion it at least makes the further work section easy to write.
The obvious first task is to figure out what is causing stimuli to not work
which is simply a matter of time.
