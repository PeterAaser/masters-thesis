We argue that, though that kind of work is of course indispensable, computation cannot be understood or even properly defined if it is not placed in the context of the evolutionary feedback loop that brought it into being and continually monitors its adaptive fitness with respect to its ultimate goals within the organism that employs it.},

	abstract = {In order for computation to emerge spontaneously and become an important factor in the dynamics of a system, the material substrate must support the primitive functions required for computation: the transmission, storage, and modification of information. Under what conditions might we expect physical systems to support such computational primitives? This paper presents research on cellular automata which suggests that the optimal conditions for the support of information transmission, storage, and modification, are achieved in the vicinity of a phase transition. We observe surprising similarities between the behaviors of computations and systems near phase transitions, finding analogs of computational complexity classes and the halting problem within the phenomenology of phase transitions. We conclude that there is a fundamental connection between computation and phase transitions, especially second-order or “critical” transitions, and discuss some of the implications for our understanding of nature if such a connection is borne out.},

In this paper, a new design of an intelligent system merging biological intelligence with artificial intelligence was created. It was based on a neural controller bidirectionally connected to an actual mobile robot to implement a novel vehicle. Two types of experimental preparations were utilized as the neural controller including ‘random’ and ‘4Q’ (cultured neurons artificially divided into four interconnected parts) neural network. Compared to the random cultures, the ‘4Q’ cultures presented absolutely different activities, and the robot controlled by the ‘4Q’ network presented better capabilities in search tasks. Our results showed that neural cultures could be successfully employed to control an artificial agent; the robot performed better and better with the stimulus because of the short-term plasticity. A new framework is provided to investigate the bidirectional biological-artificial interface and develop new strategies for a future intelligent system using these simplified model systems.},

	abstract = {Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye. During its foraging behaviour the cell spans spatially distributed sources of nutrients with a protoplasmic network. Geometrical structure of the protoplasmic networks allows the plasmodium to optimize transfer of nutrients between remote parts of its body, to distributively sense its environment, and make a decentralized decision about further routes of migration. We consider the ten most populated urban areas in United Kingdom and study what would be an optimal layout of transport links between these urban areas from the "plasmodium's point of view". We represent geographical locations of urban areas by oat flakes, inoculate the plasmodium in Greater London area and analyse the plasmodium's foraging behaviour. We simulate the behaviour of the plasmodium using a particle collective which responds to the environmental conditions to construct and minimise transport networks. Results of our scoping experiments show that during its colonization of the experimental space the plasmodium forms a protoplasmic network isomorphic to a network of major motorways except the motorway linking England with Scotland. We also imitate the reaction of transport network to disastrous events and show how the transport network can be reconfigured during natural or artificial cataclysms. The results of the present research lay a basis for future science of bio-inspired urban and road planning.},

Recently however, researchers have begun exploring alternative computational systems based on entirely different principles. Although emerging from disparate domains, the work behind these systems shares a common computational philosophy, which the author calls cellular computing. This philosophy promises to provide new means for doing computation more efficiently-in terms of speed, cost, power dissipation, information storage, and solution quality. Simultaneously, cellular computing offers the potential of addressing much larger problem instances than previously possible, at least for some application domains. Cellular computing has attracted increasing research interest. Work in this field has produced results that hold prospects for a bright future. Yet questions must be answered before cellular computing can become a mainstream paradigm. What classes of computational tasks are most suited to it? How do we match the specific properties and behaviors of a given model to a suitable class of problems? At its heart, cellular computing consists of three principles: simplicity, vast parallelism, and locality},

Furthermore, we describe the bio- and nano-technological procedures utilized for the culture of such dissociated neural networks and the interface software and hardware framework used for creating a closed-loop hybrid neuro-system.

In a majority of Evolution-in-Materio work the dynamics of the material is filtered out, or the problem is defined in a way that the sought solution is a point attractor. In this work we explore the dynamics of materials. Within the assumption that suited materials include rich behavior emerging from the underlying physical processes there should be observable behavior similar to Dynamical Systems with Dynamical Structures ((DS) 2 ). Such behavior result in systems with a possibility of inducing perturbations to their own dynamics. Further, the importance of the observation level used when observing and interpreting the state of the materials is discussed and related to dynamics in Evolution-in-Materio systems. }

Local interactions between the magnets gives rise to a range of complex collective behavior. The ferromagnets form large networks of nonlinear nodes, which in many ways resemble artificial neural networks. In this work, we investigate key computational properties of ASI through micromagnetic simulations. Our nanomagnetic system exhibits a large number of reachable stable states and a wide range of available dynamics when perturbed by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, we find that the system is able to store and process temporal input patterns. The emergent behavior is highly tunable by varying the parameters of the external field. Our findings highlight ASI as a very promising substrate for in-materio computation at the nanoscale. }
